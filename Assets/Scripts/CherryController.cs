    /*This script implements the spawning and movement of the bonus cherry sprite created in the previous assessment.
      o The bonus cherry should spawn once every 10 seconds.

      o It should be instantiated at a random location just outside of the camera view on any side of the level.
          The starting location should be different every time.

      o It should move in a straight line, via linear lerping, from one side of the screen to the other, passing through
          the center point of the level and ignoring collisions with walls, ghosts, and pellets.
          
      o If the cherry reaches the other side of the level, outside of camera view, destroy it.*/
